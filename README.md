First steps are to develop the UI for this project.
Add and create the tree of the site.
Second make the site responsive for mobile and tablet.
Add additional react libraies, if needed.
When adding the components, components must be able to click and switch to the other component.
Two components add are 'Todo List' and 'Contact'.
Next work on list item for the site
Site must have a space for a 'add todo' in order to list out todo items.
There should be a strikethrough when item is complete.
Then a delete option once the item needs to be cleared from list.
Data struture in the UseState, used to store the items

How to use TodosList! The end user should be able to type right a way in the add todo, a list of items needing to be complete on a daily basis. Then the client can hit the submit button to render the list for each todo. EACH todo will have its own strikethrough and delete option. The user can then choose what will be completed or deleted with just a click of a button. Then the user can click on the Contact component to navigate to the contact information form. The user is able to fill out the first, last name, email address and Password. Then the user will hit submit and the information will disapper. There is not a database installed on this app but will for future improvements.

Future Improvements!
Adding a database will be great at storing contact information of multiple users.
Advertising additional components on the site will allow for a greater user experience.
Adding a calender to allow the user to prioritse todo items, will allow the user to become more organized with there items list.
